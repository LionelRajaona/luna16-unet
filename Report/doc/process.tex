overview

\subsection{dataset}
The Luna16 dataset consists of about 10 GB of mdh and raw files. The files contain a varying number of slices of 512 x 512 pixel images. For this work just a subset of the data was used for training and evaluation.

\subsection{Preprocessing of image data}
file conversion
normalization on mean and sd
picture of normalized
loading data in numpy
label transformation to just one/two labels

\subsection{Training and validation}

building of networks
describe it (dice loss and bce dice loss)
hold out evaluation
threshold, export files to nii.gz

\subsection{Handling huge dataset}
- ram issue
- generator solution
- still problems with data import size
