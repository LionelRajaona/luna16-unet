overview

\subsection{dataset}

The used dataset is from the LUNA16 challenge and each scan contains a number of slices. The algorithm creates a label map for each slice marking every pixel that is part of the lung. An example of one scan and the corresponding labeling is shown in figure \ref{scan_picture}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{CT scan of the lung and labeled lung (green) and the tube (yellow). The first picture represents one slice of the image, the second a 3D representation of the label and the lower two pictures are visualizations of the side and front view.}
	\label{scan_picture}
\end{figure}

The dataset consists of about 10 GB of mdh and raw files. The files contain a varying number of slices of 512 x 512 pixel grey-scale images and corresponding 512 x 512 pixel label maps. Since computational resources were limited just a subset of the data was used for this work. Furthermore the more detailed label map was reduced to one label for the lungs and one label for the tube.

\subsection{Preprocessing of image data}
Each file was converted to a NIfTI image file for better processing and visualization. For more appropriate input values each image was normalized ($\mu = 0.0$ and $\sigma = 1.0$) separately.

\subsection{Training and validation}

building of networks
describe it (dice loss and bce dice loss)
hold out evaluation
threshold, export files to nii.gz

\subsection{Handling huge dataset}
- ram issue
- generator solution
- still problems with data import size
