Semantic segmentation of anatomical structures from medical image volumes is a common subject of research in biomedical engineering. Traditional techniques pre-dating deeplearning for medical image segmentation include thresholding, atlas-based segmentation, and statistical shape modeling. A paper comparing the capabilities of thresholding, region-based, shape-based, anatomy-guided, and machine learning approaches for segmenting structures in the lungs has been done in 2015 \cite{comparison:article_typical}. This report found that
