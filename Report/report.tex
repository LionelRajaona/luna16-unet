\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this work two deep convolutional neuronal network architectures for medical image segmentation; DeepMedic and U-Net were compared for performance in the task of automatically creating segmentations of lung structures in clinical computed tomography (CT) scans. The algorithms were trained on a portion of the LUNA16 dataset and the results were compared and evaluated using different metrics for determining segmentation accuracy and quality.
